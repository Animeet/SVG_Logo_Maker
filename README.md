# **SVG LOGO MAKER**

  ## **Description**
  - Based on your answers to the prompts that show when you invoke 'node index.js' in the terminal, this application will provide a an svg image through your browser.

  - This application taught me much more about inquirers, and how we can use constructors on a more broadened spectrum.
